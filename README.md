Various Coding Puzzles with Solutions in C Sharp

This repo holds coding puzzles with solutions I have written in C Sharp.  The solution file is a Visual Studio 2013 console application.

Here's a list of the .cs files and their associated puzzle.

1. Create a queue with two stacks
 - Two_Stack_Queue.cs

2. Fizz Buzz - Write a program that prints numbers from 1 to 100.  For multiples of three print "Fizz" instead of the number, for multiples of five print "Buzz instead of the number and for numbers which are multiples of both three and five print "FizzBuzz"
 - FizzBuzz.cs

3. Factorial - Write a program that calculates the factorial of a given number.  Ex. factorial of 4 is (4 * 3 * 2 * 1 ) = 24
 - Factorial.cs

4. Recursive Factorial - Write a program that calculates the factorial of a given number using recursion.  The myCodeSchool Youtube channel has a good explanation of recursive factorial in C++ here:

 - Factorial_Recursive.cs

Please let me know if you find any errors in the solutions.
