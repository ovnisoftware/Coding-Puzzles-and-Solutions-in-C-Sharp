Various Coding Puzzles with Solutions in C Sharp

This repo holds coding puzzles with solutions I have written in C Sharp.  The solution file is a Visual Studio 2013 console application.

### Array Puzzles Folder
1. Count the number of elements that two arrays have in common  
CountArrayCommonElements.cs

2. Find the uncoupled integer in a given array  
FindUncoupledInts.cs

3. Find majority element in an unsorted array  
MajorityUnsortedArray.cs

4. Write a function to return the maximum value stored in an array of non-negative integers  
MaxValueOfArray.cs

5. Write a function to swap the min and max element in an integer array  
MinMaxArraySwap.cs

6. Write a function that reverses an array of integers  
ReverseArray.cs

7. Write a method to sort the elements of an array in descending order  
SortDesc.cs

8. Given an integer and an array of integers determine whether any two integers in the array sum to that integer  
TargetSum.cs 

9. Transform an array of items into a dictionary  
TransformArray.cs

10. Given an array of integers, find if the array contains any duplicates. Your function should return true if any value appears at least twice in the array, and it should return false if every element is distinct.  
ArrayDuplicates.cs

### Bitwise Puzzles Folder
1. Check equality of two ints using bitwise operators  
IsEqual.cs

### Math Puzzles Folder
1. Convert a binary string to an integer without using the Convert.ToInt32 class

HexToBinary.cs

3. Write a function to determine if a TicTacToe board has a winner  
TicTacToeWinner.cs

4. Given a non-negative integer num, repeatedly add all its digits until the result has only one digit  
AddDigits.cs

5. Write a function to determine if a given number is prime  
CheckPrime.cs

6. Write a method to simulate rolling a six-sided die  
Dice.cs

7. Write a function that calculates the factorial of a given number.  Ex. factorial of 4 is (4 * 3 * 2 * 1 ) = 24  
FactorialIterative.cs

8. Write a function that calculates the factorial of a given number using recursion  
Factorial_Recursive.cs

9. Write a function that prints the nth number in the Fibonacci Sequence using iteration  
FibonacciIterative.cs

10. Write a function that prints the nth number in the Fibonacci Sequence using recursion  
FibonacciRecursive.cs

11. Write a function that prints numbers from 1 to 100.  For multiples of three print "Fizz" instead of the number, for multiples of five print "Buzz instead of the number and for numbers which are multiples of both three and five print "FizzBuzz"  
FizzBuzz.cs

12. Write a function that accepts two integers and returns the remainder  
ReturnRemainder.cs

13. A child is running up a staircase with n steps, and can hop either 1, 2, or 3 steps at a time.  Implement a method to count how many possible ways the child can run up the stairs.  
ClimbingStairs.cs

###Stack Puzzles Folder
1. Reverse a stack  
ReverseStack.cs

2. Write a function to reverse a string using a stack  
ReverseStringWithStack.cs

3. Write a function to determine the maximum of a stack  
StackMax.cs

4. Create a queue with two stacks  
TwoStackQueue.cs

5. How would you design a stack which, in addition to push and pop, also has a function min which returns the minimum element? Push, pop and min should all operate in O(1) time  
MinStack.cs

###String Manipulation Puzzles Folder
1. Given two strings s and t, write a function to determine if t is an anagram of s.  Ex. listen and silent are anagrams  
IsAnagram.cs

2. Write a function to determine if a string is a palindrome  
IsPalindrome.cs

3. A ransom note can be formed by cutting characters out of a magazine to form a new sentence.  How would you figure out if a ransom note (represented as a string) can be formed from a given magazine (string)?  
RansomNote.cs

4. Remove all characters from a string except for these characters: [ { } ( ) ] without using Regex  
RemoveChars.cs

5. Write a function to replace all spaces in a string with '%20'  
ReplaceSpace.cs

6. Reverse words in a string  
ReverseWords.cs

7. Write a function that takes a string and outputs that same string with only one space between each word  
SingleSpace.cs

8. Write a function to determine if a string has all unique characters  
UniqueString.cs

9. Count the number of words in a string (Needs to handle multiple spaces between words)  
WordCount.cs

10. Check a string for balanced delimiters  
BalancedDelimiters.cs

11. Given two strings, write a method to decide if one is a permutation of the other.  dog is a permutation of god, algorithm is case sensitive and white space counts  
IsPermutation.cs
